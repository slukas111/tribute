    <h3>Life and Career Timeline</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1938</strong> Born January 2 Mount Vernon, New York, U.S.</li>
      <li><strong>1954</strong> Graduated High School favoring Mathmatics and Sciences</li>
      <li><strong>1955</strong> Entered MIT</li>
      <li><strong>1957</strong> Left MIT after attempted gender transition</li>
      <li><strong>1958</strong> Worked as a electronics technician for several years</li>
      <li><strong>1960</strong> Entered Columbia University</li>
      <li><strong>1962</strong> Obtained BS  and MSEE Engineering and Applied Sciences</li>
      <li><strong>1964</strong> Recruited by IBM Research in Yorktown Heights, New York</li>
      <li><strong>1964</strong> Selected to join architecture team in deisgning an advanced supercomputer</li>
      <li><strong>1965</strong> Obtained BS Engineering and Applied Sciences</li>
      <li><strong>1968</strong> Was married with two children. IBM fired her after management learned of transition intentions</li>
      <li><strong>1968</strong> Started a new career in "stealth-mode" with a new identity as a contract programmer</li>
      <li><strong>1969</strong> Accepted a position at Memorex as a digital system designer and computer architect</li>
      <li><strong>1973</strong> Joined Xerox PARC where she lead "LSI systems group"</li>
      <li><strong>1974</strong> Conway founded the "multiproject wafers" (MPW). This new technology made it possible to pack multiple circuit designs from various sources into one single chip. Her new invention increased production and decreased costs</li>
      <li><strong>1975</strong> Collaborating with Ivan Sutherland and Carver Mead of Caltech on VLSI design methodology, she co-authored Introduction to VLSI Systems, a groundbreaking work that would soon become a standard textbook in chip design, used in nearly 120 universities by 1983.</li>
      <li><strong>1978</strong> Conway served as visiting associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, teaching a now famous VLSI design course based on a draft of the Meadâ€“Conway text.</li>
      <li><strong>1981</strong> Conway's contributions were the invention of dimensionless, scalable design rules that greatly simplified chip design and design tools, and invention of a new form of internet-based infrastructure for rapid prototyping and short-run fabrication of large numbers of chip designs. The new infrastructure was institutionalized as the Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service (MOSIS) system</li>
      <li><strong>1982</strong> Conway left Xerox to join DARPA, where she was a key architect of the Defense Department's Strategic Computing Initiative, a research program studying high-performance computing, autonomous systems technology, and intelligent weapons technology</li>
      <li><strong>1985</strong> Joined University of Michingan as professor of electrical engineering and computer science</li>
      <li><strong>1987</strong> Conway met her husband Charles "Charlie" Rogers, a professional engineer who shares her interest in the outdoors, including whitewater canoeing and motocross racing</li>
      <li><strong>1998</strong> She retired from active teaching and research, as professor emerita at Michigan</li>
      <li><strong>1999</strong> Began quietly coming out as as trans woman to friends and colleagues</li>
      <li><strong>2002</strong> Married Charles Rogers</li>
      <li><strong>2009</strong> Conway was named one of the "Stonewall 40 trans heroes" on the 40th anniversary of the Stonewall riots by the International Court System, one of the oldest and largest predominantly gay organizations in the world, and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.</li>
      <li><strong>2013</strong> with support from many prominent thought-leaders in high-technology, Conway and her colleague Leandra Vicci of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill successfully lobbied the board of directors of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for transgender inclusion in the IEEE's Code of Ethics</li>
      <li><strong>2020</strong> 52 years after IBM fired her for being transgender, IBM officially and publicly apologized to Conway; IBM held a public event "Tech Trailblazer and Transgender Pioneer Lynn Conway in conversation with Diane Gherson" </li>
    </ul>
